            <h2>Semester Reflection</h2>
            <!-- Reflection on learning and growth throughout the semester -->
            <p><strong>What I learned:</strong> I've learned how to use different software like GitHub to highlight my skills. I also learned how to add pictures to my site and create interactive data visualizations using tools like Tableau. Understanding how to structure HTML and style with CSS has given me the foundation to build professional web portfolios.</p>
            <p><strong>Challenges I overcame:</strong> At first, I was confused about how to find different code types and understand HTML structure. Learning to debug issues like broken links and navigation problems helped me become more comfortable with web development. I also learned to think critically about data visualization and how to present information effectively.</p>
            <p><strong>How I grew:</strong> My understanding of digital culture and data analytics has evolved from just consuming content to creating it. I can now analyze how AI tools work, critique data visualizations, and build my own interactive projects that tell stories through data.</p>
            <p><strong>Looking ahead:</strong> I plan to apply these skills in my Strategic Communications work by combining storytelling with data-driven insights. Understanding both the creative and analytical sides will help me make smarter decisions about content creation and audience engagement.</p>
