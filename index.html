            <p><strong>Who I am:</strong> My name is Natalie Magee and I am a Junior Strategic Communications Major and Digitial Culture and Data Analytics Minor at Texas Christian University! </p>

            <p><strong>My interests:</strong> I’m passionate about digital culture and how people interact with content online. I love storytelling, but I’m just as interested in the data behind it. That’s what drew me to my DCDA minor it helps me blend creativity with analytics and understand why certain ideas resonate with certain people. </p>
           <!-- I added what I hope to learn so that I can reflect on it at the end of the semester and see if I was able to achieve those goals.  --> 
            <p><strong> What I hope to learn: </strong> I hope to learn how to better understand audience behavior online and use data to make smarter creative decisions. I want to feel confident not just creating content, but knowing why it works and how to improve it.</p>
