    <h2>Reflection & Analysis</h2>

    <p>
The first problem I had while trying to complete this lab was the CSV file not downloading properly. When looking through the different data set options I was drawn to one that focused on the data around the 2016 presidential candidates. I found my data set quickly but as I opened it, it just kept giving me raw text. To figure out how to fix this I asked chat gpt and learned how to manually save it. The next problem I ran into was Tableau not labeling “Number of Records” clearly, which forced me to again have to look up what the other name for it could be in order to know what section to put it under and how to use it properly. There were also unknown locations on the map which confused me at first. Through these issues though I learned that data is not perfect and it's not all the same so you have to be able to think critically about the different names involved in a data set. When choosing the design I wanted to use to visualize my data, I had to think about what would best reflect political data. For this data set I thought maps would be helpful to see the distribution of candidates and their parties. I also thought having the circle sizes would be helpful to be able to quickly glance and see where the most candidates from each party were from. I also thought a bar chart would add more context because it would be another easy way to see the distinctions between the parties and the states. Prior to visualizing this data set, I would have assumed that larger states like California, Texas, and Florida would have more candidates and I believe the visualization did confirm that. I also would have expected that the circles in the south would lean more republican and the coastal states would lean more democratic. California had the largest cluster but something that surprised me was how thin the independent/ other category was. This made me curious about why certain states attract more independent candidates, and if candidate volume correlates with population size. Personally, I think that it would be a fair assumption that there would be correlation between population and candidate size because it is logical that the more people there are the more would be willing to run. It was interesting to see how the amount of candidates spread out across states and I would like to look into how the states voting reacted to the different candidates. I think that Tableau helped a lot because it had very easy geographic visualization and it was cool how you can just drag things around and kind of play around until you are able to see the data in a way that makes sense. I also thought it was able to make a clean dashboard which was helpful as a final way to see the different ways I was able to interpret the data. Tableau struggled a little with the statistical depth that may be needed to fully understand this data set and it was a little hard at times to compare the maps and the scales across all the sheets, but I still think it was a good start to begin to visualize this data set.     </p>
