            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>For this project, I explored using ChatGPT and Canva Magic Studio to better understand how commonly used AI tools actually actually in academic and creative workflows. I chose these tools because they are easy to access, widely used by students, and relevant to both writing and visual communication. My goal was not just to see what they could produce, but to also see where they are were actually helpful and where you still need a human to ensure it is correct. </p>

            <h2>Tool 1: Chat GPT</h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>I've found that ChatGPT works best as a brainstorming and organization tool. When I used it to outline responses, reword ideas, or help me think through how to approach an assignment, it was extremely helpful. For example, it helped me structure a response by breaking a prompt into clear sections, which made the writing process less overwhelming. However, ChatGPT can not be as good when it comes to specificity and depth, for example if prompts are vague, the responses tend to sound generic. It also does not inherently know the context of a class or assignment unless that information is explicitly provided, which means the output still requires revision to ensure accuracy and originality.</p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>Canva Magic Studio is best used for first drafts, visual inspiration, or speeding up the layout process. It is not as good for final presentations that require strong messaging, data accuracy, or custom branding. Over-reliance on this could result in work that looks good but lacks substance.</p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>A major ethical concern with Canva Magic Studio is originality. This is because many users rely on similar AI-generated layouts and text, designs can become repetitive. Canva encourages customization, but it is the user’s responsibility to ensure the final work reflects their own ideas and effort.</p>

            <h2>Tool 2: Canva Magic Studio </h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>Canva Magic Studio is good for visual organization and layout generation. When prompted to create presentation slides, it quickly made designs that were visually clean and easy to follow. This makes it helpful for translating ideas into visual form, especially when time is limited. However, the text content Canva generates is often vague and requires editing. While the designs look polished, they do not always communicate ideas clearly or accurately without human input. </p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>ChatGPT is best used during the early stages of writing, such as brainstorming ideas, or organizing thoughts. It is not as appropriate for generating final drafts, original arguments, or source-based analysis without human oversight. Using it passively can lead to surface-level work that lacks personal voice or critical engagement.</p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>The main ethical concern with ChatGPT is that I've found is the loss of original work. While ChatGPT can provide general oulines and brainstorming ideas, the tool itself does not prevent misuse. Ethical use depends on the user actively engaging with and revising the output rather than submitting it as is.</p>

            <h2>Broader Reflections</h2>
            <p>I think that AI tools can be used to brainstorm and think of ideas rather than final drafts in my academic and professional work. ChatGPT helps me organize and clarify ideas, while Canva Magic Studio makes it easier to turn those ideas into visuals, but neither replaces my own thinking or creativity. Within the DCDA program, these tools can support experimentation, content creation, and efficiency, but relying on them too heavily could weaken skills like critical analysis and original design thinking. What remains totally human is the ability to understand context, culture, and make strategic decisions. As AI tools continue to evolve, it’s important to think about what they actually do well, where they fall short, and whether they help users think more critically or simply work faster.</p>
